Hard Assertion use case
    -in a single test case despite of the number of assertions
    if you want your test case to fail even if the first assertion is failed
    you can use hard assertion

Soft Assertion use case
    -in a single test case you have more than 1 assertions
    and you want to know which are the ones that are failing then
    you can you soft assertion

        soft assertion will not mark the test case as Failed immediately
        even if one assertion has failed it is going to keep on asserting other
        conditions and at the end will return you with the result

        When you use SoftAssert, you need to call its assertAll() method
        at the end of the test case to report all the failures that occurred
        during the test case execution.

soft.assertAll();
        -is a soft assertion method that collects all
         the assertion failures and reports them together at the end of the test case
         execution. This allows the test case to continue executing
         even if there are assertion failures, and provides a more comprehensive
         report of all the failures that occurred during the test case.

         soft.assertAll() is useful when a test case has multiple assertions
         and you want to ensure that all assertions are executed,
         and that all the failures are reported,
         without terminating the test case execution prematurely.

Approach only for soft assertion
1. create an object of softAssert
2. call the assert from softassert
3. once you have written down all the assertion
4. at the end must write soft.assertAll(); to report add the failures that occurred during the test case
