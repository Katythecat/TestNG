-----------listeners in testNG---

Listeners:

Listeners class listen to events like test failed /pass /skipped e.t.c
once the testcase has executed
and it either fails /pass /skips
depending upon the status
listeners class takes you to the execution of the code that you have written for the scenarios
if your test case fails/ pass or skips


Implementation of listeners class:

listeners class implements ITestListeners

which is an interface from TestNG
and we overRide the functions in it according to our need

after that you need to link the listeners class to the class on which you want it to listen
that can be done using TextNG.XML

u define ur <listeners> tag just under <suite>


Annotations:

@Test           - all the test cases are written here
@BeforeMethod   - runs everytime before @Test (precondition)
@AfterMethod    - runs after every @Test (post condition)
@BeforeClass    - run only 1 time before the execution of a class
        Ex. we will write the method to read the file here(ConfigReader.readProperties();)

@AfterClass     - run only 1 time after the execution of a class
@BeforeTest     - run only 1 time before test(establish connection)
@AfterTest
@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite
