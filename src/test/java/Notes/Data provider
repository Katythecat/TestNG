---------Data Provider-----------
Used for dataDriven testing
DataProviders in TestNG are another way to pass the parameters in the test function.
DataProviders pass different values to the TestNG Test Case in a single execution

Note: TestNG comes up with DataProvider to automate the process of providing test cases for execution.
DataProvider helps with data-driven test cases that carry the same methods but can be run multiple times
with different data sets. It also helps in providing complex parameters to the test methods.
Data Provider also call data driven testing
we use @DataProvider to set the data here
how to set
    1. must have annotation @DataProvider
    2. it must have a name @DataProvider(name=" ")
    3. it must be 2d array
        public Object[][] data(){
                Object[][] loginData={
                        {"Admin", "12345", "Invalid credential"},
                        {"ABCD", "Hum@nhrm123", "Invalid credentials"},
                        {"Admin", "", "Password cannot be empt"},
                        {"", "Hum@nhrm123", "Username cannot be empt"}
                };
                return  loginData;
                }


@Test
we must connect with data provider to read the data
how
1. we must connect with name of data provider
    @Test(dataProvider = " name of data provider")
2. in order to get the data we must have parameters for the function
    public void invalidCredentials(String username,String password, String errorMsg)


   then when we execute it will be like this
   BeforeMethod
   @Test()
   AfterMethod

   BeforeMethod
   @Test()
   AfterMethod

   BeforeMethod
   @Test()
   AfterMethod

   BeforeMethod
   @Test()
   AfterMethod

   but if we have a hundred data we will read from excel and learn it by yourself they don't teach you
